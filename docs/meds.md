# Medication

Finn is a very low-maintenance dog. He's very healthy for his age & breed, and only needs preventative parasite control.

## Anti-parasite Pill

Finn takes a monthly pill to prevent him from getting infected by heartworm and flea & tick. It's called Simparica TRIO and he doesn't need any encouragement to take the pill, just tell him it's a treat and get him hyped up before giving it to him!
