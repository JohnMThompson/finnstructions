# Walks & Outdoor Time

Finn doesn't need many walks in a day. One is usually fine, though he will be happy to be outside as much as possible.

During warm weather, he likes to sit outside in the sunshine on a deck or in a yard.

## Caution

Finn needs to be on a rope or leash at all times when he is outside. He will run off if he gets distracted or scared.
