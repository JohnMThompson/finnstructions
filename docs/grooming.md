# Grooming

Finn's fur is a double coat. One the one hand, this is great because he never needs to get his fur trimmed. The downside is that he sheds a lot. A lot.

## Regular De-Shedding

Finn goes in to Petco for grooming about every 6-8 weeks. They give him a shed release bath and then a de-shedding routine that removes a lot of his undercoat. He comes out of it looking sleek and feeling good!

## Nail Trim

Finn's nails grow quite quickly and he gets nail trims at each grooming session and once in between as well. Finn is a "jumper" and having his nails trimmed consistently keeps him from scratching people accidentally.

## At Home Baths

If Finn gets into any stinky stuff while he is outside, he will do fine with a bath in the bathtub. We use a general dog shampoo to clean him up, and have been successful removing even skunk smell!
