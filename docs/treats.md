# Treats & Chews

## Treats

Finn loves treats and often gets one after coming in from a walk or being outside. His favorites include mini-milk bones and small soft training treats.

## Chews

Finn enjoys the occasional rawhide chew. It's best to limit his bones to only a couple per week so he doesn't get an upset stomach.
