# Finn's Story

Finn was adopted in 2014 from the Animal Humane Society in Wichita, KS. When he was found, Finn was a stray roaming the streets and was very timid and scared.

The AHS cleaned him up and kept him "behind the scenes" for several weeks to help him overcome his anxiety and fear of his new situation.

Finn moved to Minnesota in 2017 and has found a new and wonderful life!
