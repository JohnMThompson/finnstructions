# Finn's Story

Finn was adopted in 2014 from the Animal Humane Society in Wichita, KS. When he was found, Finn was a stray roaming the streets and was very timid and scared.

The AHS cleaned him up and kept him "behind the scenes" for several weeks to help him overcome his anxiety and fear of his new situation. Finn was adopted in July of 2016 and started his new life filled with treats, visits to the dog park, and naps in the sun.

Finn moved to Minnesota in 2017 and has found a new and wonderful life!
