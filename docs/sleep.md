# Sleeping Arrangements

Finn always sleeps in his kennel. He is happy to go in with the assistance of a treat.

If permitted, he would also gladly sleep in the bed with someone. He has a tendency to want to go under the covers to stay extra cozy.

If he is not in his kennel at night, he is more prone to having accidents in the house. I recommend always using the kennel.
