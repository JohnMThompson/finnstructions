## About

This project is a personal documentation site for caring for my dog, Finn. As I build it, I'm using it both as a reference for Finn’s routines, health, training, etc., *and* as a way to learn and experiment with documentation tooling.  

Built with:

- [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) — static site generator  
- [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) — theme  

---

## Features

- Clean, responsive site design  
- Navigation structure for docs (e.g. care, training, feeding, routines)  
- Easy markdown-based content — simple to update  
- Deployed live (GitHub Pages / other host)  
- Theme customizations (colors, styles, layout)  

---

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project locally to develop or preview changes.

### Prerequisites

- Python (3.x)  
- `pip` to install Python packages  

### Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JohnMThompson/finnstructions.git
   cd finnstructions
   ```

2. Install dependencies  
   ```bash
   pip install mkdocs
   pip install mkdocs-material
   ```

   (Alternatively, if you use a `requirements.txt` or `dev` requirements, install via that.)

3. Serve locally  
   ```bash
   mkdocs serve
   ```

   Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser to view the site. Changes you make in Markdown will automatically rebuild.

4. Build for production / deploy  
   ```bash
   mkdocs build
   ```

   Then deploy the `site/` folder to hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.) as configured.

## Project Structure

```
finnstructions/
├── docs/           ← markdown files (your content)
├── site/           ← generated static site output
├── mkdocs.yml      ← configuration file for MkDocs
├── .github/        ← GitHub actions / workflows
├── .cache/         ← build cache, plugins
└── ...             ← other config or theme‐related directories
```

Some key files/folders:

- `docs/` — where all your documentation pages live  
- `mkdocs.yml` — controls navigation, theme settings, plugins  
- `.github/workflows/` — if you have CI/CD or deployment automation setup  
- `site/` — generated files (don’t edit manually)

---

## Customizations

Here are some of the theme/plugin customizations or extras you might already have (or could add):

- Material theme settings: colors, navigation depth, icon usage  
- Plugins (search, redirects, etc.)  
- Custom CSS overrides  
- Metadata (site descriptions, favicon)  

---

- Create a branch for your change  
- Submit a pull request
