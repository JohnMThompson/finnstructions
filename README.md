# finnstructions

This is a repo where I'm learning MkDocs.

MkDocs is a static site generator focused on project documentation. Find out more at their site: [mkdocs.org](https//mkdocs.org)

I'm also using the Material theme for MkDocs, more about that project here: [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)

Since I needed some subject matter for the content, I chose a topic I know pretty much everything about - my dog Finn!
